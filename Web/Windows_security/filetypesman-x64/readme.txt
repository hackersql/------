Description
===========

FileTypesMan is an alternative to the 'File Types' tab in the 'Folder
Options' of Windows. It displays the list of all file extensions and
types registered on your computer. For each file type, the following
information is displayed: Type Name, Description, MIME Type, Perceived
Type, Flags, Browser Flags, and more.
FileTypesMan also allows you to easily edit the properties and flags of
each file type, as well as it allows you to add, edit, and remove actions
in a file type.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works on any version of Windows from Windows 98 to Windows
10. For using this utility under Windows 98/ME, you must download the
non-Unicode version. For using this utility under x64 system, you should
download the x64 version.



Known Issue In Windows 98/ME
============================

In some Windows 98 machines, an exception with CDFVIEW.DLL is occurred
when starting FileTypesMan. To avoid this problem, go to the Options
menu, and choose the 'Don't Load Icons' option. After that, FileTypesMan
should work properly, but without displaying the icons according to file
types.

Versions History
================


* Version 1.83:
  o When you run FileTypesMan, it now automatically selects the last
    selected extension.
  o Added /SelectedExt command-line option for selecting the desired
    extension in the upper pane, for example:
    FileTypesMan.exe /SelectedExt ".txt"

* Version 1.82:
  o Added 'Icon Handler CLSID' column. When a file type has an icon
    handler, the icon handler set the actual icon that will be displayed
    for the file, instead of the 'Default Icon' value.

* Version 1.81:
  o Added Drive and Directory\Background types.
  o Fixed bug: FileTypesMan displayed incorrect Registry keys for
    Directory.

* Version 1.80:
  o Added 'Detach File Type' button to the 'Replace File Type For
    Selected Extension' option, which allows you to detach a file type
    from the selected file extension and leave the file extension as a
    standalone extension without a file type. If you detach a file type
    from a file extension, changing the icon and menu items won't affect
    other file extensions (Be aware that you may also need to clear the
    'User Choice' field, if it's not empty)
  o Added '...' button to the 'User Choice' field, which opens a
    window that allows you to easily choose the desired file type.
  o Fixed FileTypesMan to use the correct file type Registry key,
    when there is a CurVer subkey that redirects to other file type key.
    In previous versions, FileTypesMan failed to change the icon and menu
    items of .pdf and other extensions due to this bug.
  o FileTypesMan now stores the selected font in the .cfg file.
  o FileTypesMan now displays an error message if it fails to modify
    action or file type.

  o Fixed a crash problem occurred while loading the icon of
    .appref-ms extension, on some systems.

    their icons, in order to avoid a crash.

    FileTypesMan will display a list of file extensions that might be
    affected by editing the file type.

Start Using FileTypesMan
========================

FileTypesMan doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply copy the executable file
(FileTypesMan.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.
After running it, you should wait a few seconds until the file types list
is loaded. If the loading process is too slow, it's recommended to turn
off the icons loading (Options->Don't Load Icons in menu), so in the next
time that you run FileTypesMan, the loading process will be faster.
The main window of FileTypesMan contains 2 panes. The upper pane displays
the list of all extensions/file types registered on your computer. When
you select a single file type in the upper pane, the lower pane displays
the list of all actions of the selected type.



'Replace File Type For Selected Extension' option (F4)
======================================================

Sometimes, when you install a new software, it automatically replaces the
file types associated with various file extensions. This means that when
you double-click the file, the new installed application is opened,
instead of the old one. The icon of the extension is usually also
replaced to the icon of the new application.
The 'Replace File Type' feature allows you to set the file extension back
to the original file type. In order to do that, select the desired file
extension in the main window of FileTypesMan, and press F4. You'll get a
long list of available file types on your computer. Find and select the
previous file type that handled the extension, and choose 'Ok'.



Desktop Refresh
===============

Each time that you make a change in the properties of a file type,
FileTypesMan automatically initiate a general desktop refresh, so your
changes will take affect immediately, even for opened Explorer windows.
However, on slow computers, this desktop refresh might consume a fair
amount of CPU resources, and even hang the entire operating system for a
few seconds. If you want to avoid this desktop refresh on every change
that you make, simply disable the automatic refresh, by unchecking the
option under the following menu: Options->Automatic Desktop Refresh.
You can always initiate a desktop refresh when you need it, simply by
selecting 'File->Refresh Desktop Now' from the main menu.



Sending extension information to extension.nirsoft.net
======================================================

extension.nirsoft.net is a Web site that allows you to find out which
programs can open a specific file extension.
If you want, you can add the extension information stored in your
computer into extension.nirsoft.net Web site, by using the 'Send Report
to extension.nirsoft.net' option under the Help menu.(Ctrl+F9).

The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Type Name" and "Extension". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Extension") if you want to sort in descending order.
You can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by

instructions below:

   FileTypesMan.exe /savelangfile
   A file named FileTypesMan_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   FileTypesMan utility.

4. After you finish the translation, Run FileTypesMan, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run FileTypesMan without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
